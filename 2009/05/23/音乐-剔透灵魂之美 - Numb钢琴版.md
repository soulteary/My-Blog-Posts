# [音乐]剔透灵魂之美 - Numb钢琴版

![Image](https://attachment.soulteary.com/2009/05/23/Numb.Piano.jpg "Image") **<span style="color: #ff0000;">更新：Boxstr的流量一天内便超额了..现在补了一个新的链接,如果失效,可以联系我更新或者我Mail给你。</span>** 本来想写代码的，结果无意之间听到这首久违的Numb,瞬间斗志全无了。 相比查斯特经典的咆哮版本来说，这首钢琴版本的确实很特别。 说起Numb，恐怕稍微听歌的朋友都会有映像的，和It's My Life一类的歌曲中, Numb便是为数不多的既有哲理又包含激情的High歌了。 正如英文中Numb的意义一样，麻木~其实我更喜欢另外一个译名，“浑然不觉”。 在压力越来越大的社会波涛中，我们是否可以“麻木”自己，放手去冲呢~ 或许这个问题对于很多朋友来说都是一个问号，但是我相信，听罢这首歌后， 或许你会有所感想。 _i've becoming this all i want to do~enjoy the music。_ 如果你想要浏览更多的信息或进行试听下载，请点击阅读全文。 **下载链接：**[**点此下载**](http://www.box.net/shared/afg753q2qm)(Box.net) <iframe src="http://www.box.net/index.php?rm=box_v2_mp3_player_shared&amp;node=f_290603152&amp;single_file=1" width="312" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe> [Numb钢琴版](http://boxstr.com/files/5333194_dpzm5/Numb.Piano.mp3)(boxstr分享)

```text
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

**以下引自百度的fans的评价~**

> Linkin Park——世界上最优秀的现场表演摇滚团体之一，你可以说以前从没有听说过，也可以用你对音乐对时尚最挑剔的眼光审视他们，但是无论如何，林肯公园的确是这个时代最独一无二的混种音乐霸王，他们早已在全球大放异彩，尽情炫出E时代音乐风情。他们博采众家之长，容各派之精华，不经意间，首张大碟《Hybrid Theory》狂卖1500万张，销量惊人。终成大器的Linkin Park在世界范围内狂掀阵阵Linkin热浪，引发一场场“时尚风暴”。也因为乐队成员的亚裔血统而使亚洲不甘人后的新一代青年发现自身力量，冲锋陷阵于世界时尚的最前沿。Linkin Park带给我们的不仅仅是混合的音乐、前卫的时尚，在他的身后是新世代年轻人自由、博大、包容的精神世界。
