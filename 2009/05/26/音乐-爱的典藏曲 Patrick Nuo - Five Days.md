<pre class="lang:default decode:true " title="Five Days 歌词">it was love at first sight
on the second of july
met her on the third floor
four times in one night
it was a little bit of magic
and the time stood still
she took me to another side
she got the key to my will
tell me how could such a good thing only last
1234

five days

once in a lifetime

five nights

too good to be true
the universe is passin' by
but i can't forget our
1234

five days
sunshine one way tripwhere she touched my soul
when i touched her lips
she said:&quot;boy take me to wherever you go
destination anywhere&quot;
but destiny said no
tell me how could such a good thing only last
it was so great when we were together, baby
so great when we were together
it was so great, when our days were endless, baby
so great when we were together
tell me how could our forever only last</pre>
